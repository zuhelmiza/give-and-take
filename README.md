## Project overview
Give & Take is a front-end prototype that enables the community to post items/services to give away and request what they need. The focus is on HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript fundamentals without a backend.

## Features
- Multi-page site: Home, Browse, Give (form), Request (form), Profile, About, Contact
- Client-side data storage (localStorage) with search and category filter
- Optional per-item photo upload (compressed in browser)
- Responsive layout and accessible form labels

## How to run (local)
1. Unzip the project.
2. Open `index.html` in a modern browser.
   (For auto-reload during testing, VS Code Live Server may be used.)

## Page map
- `index.html` – Landing and overview
- `listings.html` – Community board with search/filter
- `post.html` – Submit a “Give” post
- `request.html` – Submit a “Request” post
- `profile.html` – Sample profile page
- `about.html`, `contact.html`

## Data & privacy behaviour
- No server/database is used.
- Posts (and optional images) are saved in the browser’s `localStorage` only.
- Images are compressed client-side (~900px max side) before storage.

## Tech stack
HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks).

## Optional live hosting
This static site can be hosted on GitHub Pages or Netlify if a live preview is required.
